  <b> Zhiyu (Zoe) Chen (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hi! I’m Zhiyu, a first year graduate student of computer science. I’m very excited to be the TA for CS16 class this quarter. This class gives you deeper knowledge of computer science world and guides you to be a great programmer. I hope all of you will enjoy it.

    <b> Taylor McCreary (Tutor)   </b>
    <i> " Hi! I'm Taylor; I was a tutor last quarter for CS8, and I am thrilled to be back for CS16. I'm hoping this class will help you gain confidence with programming and a deeper understanding of programming concepts. I'm a third year, and am part of the UCSB Data Science club. Outside of school I enjoy playing board games and watching movies with my 9 housemates in Isla Vista, and sometimes going on runs or trying yoga classes. Last summer I was able to intern at InTouch Health, a local telehealth company. Feel free to reach out to me about classes, data science, statistics, or general advice. Contact me on Piazza " </i>

  <b> Sato Koa(Tutor)  </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone! My name is Koa and I’m a third year CS major. I’m super excited to be a tutor this quarter for CS16 and I hope to help you all succeed in this class! This my second quarter as a tutor at UCSB and I look forward to learning about becoming a better tutor and developing some relationships with everyone. Outside of class, my hobbies include gaming, playing and watching basketball (Warriors fan) and watching T.V. shows. You can also come talk to me about future class schedules, professors and the like since I’m a third year who has most likely taken the classes you are planning on taking! Feel free to reach me on Piazza :).

  <i> "Hey y’all, Ben here. I’’m a fourth-year CS major and I also tutored CS 8 last quarter like some of my fellow colleagues. I love teaching and I love learning, so hopefully we can learn a lot from each other this quarter! Outside of school, I love video games, and basketball. I’m a Spurs fan and always be down to play when I’m free, so hit me up! After graduating, I hope to work as a game developer, so if you have any questions or sick game ideas and need some help, come chat with me. But, you can always come talk to me about anything, whether it’s advice or just a friendly conversation, I’ll always be around! You can also reach me on Piazza if you aren’t able to find me in person for whatever reason. I am excited to be mentoring y’all this quarter and shoutouts to my mentor group, we’re gonna have lots of fun!

  <b> Bryan Wu (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Welcome to CS 24 everyone! I’m a second-year Computer Science (CS) major. I tutored for CS 8 Fall 2017, and I’m excited to return for another opportunity to directly support fellow coders! Additionally, I would be glad to be of assistance if any of you have questions about switching into the CS major in the College of Engineering. I came into UCSB as an Economics major and made the switch to CS at the end of the Spring quarter of my first year. The process of switching into CS was a challenging struggle that grew on me initially as a dreadful archenemy, but ended up as a very close friend of mine who polished my study and life skills. On a side note, I enjoy hanging around and sleeping in cafes, traveling, gaming, playing the piano, and taking pictures. Contact me on Piazza if you have any questions about CS, or just want to chat (no Game of Thrones spoilers)! " </i>

  <b>  Madhu Kannan (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Madhu, and I’m so excited to see all of you this quarter! I’m a third year CS/English double major, and I tutored CS 8 last quarter. I am also the secretary for Engineering Student Council, the student group that plans events for CoE undergraduates. CS 16 was the first class I ever took at UCSB, and it was fundamental to helping me understand what programming was and how I was going to use it for the next four years of my time here. I hope that I can help all of you come to that understanding as well, and leave this class feeling confident about you and your skills. In my spare time, I love reading books and binge-watching TV shows with my friends. (Who doesn't?) If you ever need advice on anything - from class assignments, to planning your courses, or even just a sympathetic ear if you’re having a hard time - you can always reach me on Piazza. :)

  <b>  Robert	Stosick (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi there! My name is Robert, my pronouns are he/him/his. I am excited to be one of your mentors for CS 24. I am a senior here, studying Computer Engineering. This is my first time mentoring, but I have been very grateful for all of the TAs who have helped me throughout my time at UCSB, and I am excited to give back by having the opportunity to help you grow and develop your coding skills.

  In CS 24 you will have the opportunity to continue honing your programming skills, develop new ones, and really begin to get into Computer Science in greater depth. It is of course important to learn the course material, but I believe it is equally important to develop good coding habits early on in your CS education, because long after the specific details of what you learned in CS 24 are fuzzy, you will keep using the skills you learned.

  For non-CS majors, taking CS 24 will teach you coding skills that are valuable and give you a competitive advantage over peers who do not have these skills, and will give you a solid foundation in Computer Science (the same foundation that CS and CE majors receive) should you wish to continue learning to code in the future. With the rise of Big Data and the Internet of Things, knowing how to code is more valuable than ever in many fields.

  I imagine that the course may be tough, especially so for students who may not have had much or any programming experience prior to CS 8 and CS 16, but I will do my best to guide you through the challenges. I was once in that boat, and I am confident that you will succeed too. I will do my best to help make your journey as smooth as possible.
  I can also answer lots of questions about other CS classes here at UCSB. Please feel free to ask me questions, even if it seems like a silly question. I look forward to seeing you in lab." </i>

  <i> "Hi! My name is  Abhishek, I am a 4th year CCS Computing and Biology double major. I am super excited to be one of the mentors for CS24. Here’s a little background about me:  In the last few years I have been lucky enough to have worked with leading scientists at Stanford, UCSF and UCSB to uncover the potential of big data in computational biology. My interests lie in deep learning precision interpretation of medical imaging for the clinics. I have been involved with a number of ongoing projects in skin and breast cancer quantitative image analysis. If any of you also like these topics or just want to chat, don’t hesitate to contact me on Piazza :) " </i>
